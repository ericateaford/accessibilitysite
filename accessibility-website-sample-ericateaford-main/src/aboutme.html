                <h2> When I hear Accessibility</h2>
                <p>My name is Erica Teaford and I am a senior at Weber State University located in Ogden, UT. My major is Web and User Experience Design with
                    an emphasis in UX Design. 
                </p>
                <p>When I hear accessibility I think how imporatnt it is to make a webpage accessible so that everyone can use 
                    the site. I think of people who are like me, who sometimes struggle to focus on a task at once before their attention
                    is snagged away almost instaneously. I also think of the individuals who may have a physical disabiliity that may prevent
                    them from effectively browsing the web. With the sudden emergence of technoology, and as it grows exponentially
                    it is my responsibility that users with disabilities can not just access the web, but be able to easily navigate it. 
                    The internet is a new and ever expanding world, and everyone deserves to be able to navigate it.

                <h2>Automated Tools are NOT Enough</h2>
                <p> Automated tools are not enough when designing websites with acessibility in mind. By adding to automated tools(ex: provided a description for alt text for an image),
                    we are allowing our users with disabilities to have a deeper understanding of our website and what it can truly offer
                    our users. Instead of a robotic experience if we just used automated tools, we are allowing a connection between
                    or company and our users. They will feel welcomed when naivgating the webpage because we took time to think of them
                    in the web designing process.
