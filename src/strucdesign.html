        <h1 class="text-center">Site Design</h1>
        <p class="p-4">In this section of my site, I will be going over the visual and structural design of my Accessibility
            webpage so that you can gain a broader understanding of the implemented elements I decided to put into this webpage. 
            Also so you can understand the specific elements I implemented and how they are associated with accessibility.
        </p>
    </div>


        <div class="p-5">
        <h2 class="">Visual Design</h2>
        <h3 class="">Color of Site</h3>
        <p class="">The color scheme I chose for my site is a calming green scheme with light grays, greens, and tans
            but also with dark greens and grays. I first came up this color scheme after filing through some
        recommended schemes online. Although I knew I wanted it, I had to make sure that it was WCAG Level AA compliant. 
        </p>
        
        <p>I used webaim.com so check to make sure that my color scheme was at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio. The background color 
        of the html(#99bca8- a light green) with the overlapping text(#32363d- a dark grey) came to a 5.84:1 contrast ratio which passes Level AA. I knew I 
        didn't want to just stop at Level so I decided to use the program to create a color scheme that would pass Level AAA as well. 
        I settled with a the sae background color(#99bca8) but I increased the darkness of the text color(#24292d) this gave
        me a 7.07:1 contrast level which complied to Level AAA.  </p>

        <p> Next, I wanted to make sure that my navigation bar exceeded Level AA as well. My original color of the navigation bar was 
            #0c2d1c whihc game me a dark green. The text on the top was a light tan(#b79e9b). With this 
            scheme I still passed Level AA with a 5.95:1 ratio, but of course I wanted to pass Level AAA as well. 
            I kept my background color but adjusted the lightness of my text on the navigation bar to #C3BOAC. This 
            shot me up to a 7.19:1 contrast ratio which passed Level AAA.
        </p>

        <h3 class="">Typography</h3>
        <p class=""> For my typography I wanted something simple to read and to see so that anyone can view
            my website and the content it has. To acheive this I chose the font family, "'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif". 
            This gave my typography a large and blocky text that made it easy for anyone to see the content. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="">Layout</h3>
        <p class="">In the layout of my site I wanted to make it easy to navigate and see different elements
            on the webpage. As you can see on all of my page I used distinct padding in between each section 
        of content. I also used some lighter colored backgrounds on some elements on the homepage in order to 
        make it contrast the following sections so it's easier to tell where you are on the page. On multiple pages of the site 
        I also used flexbox with my bootstrap in order to put elements side by side in my layout. For example, I put 
        one of my chart next to the description, this will allow users to easily compare the data in the chart to the text they are reading
        instead of needing to scroll down the page in order to view the chart. </p>

        <h3 class="">Navigation</h3>
        <p class="">In the navigation of the webpage I wanted to make sure that every user will be able to see what was the 
            active page that they were on. I did this by choosing the light tan again(#C3BOAC) and then I changed the text of the 
            link to black so that it stands out against it's background. I also made sure to add a hover psuedo class color 
            so that every time a user is hovering over a tab on the navigation, it will become a lighter green. 
        </p>
    </div>


        <div class="p-5">
        <h2 class="">Structural Design</h2>
       
        <h3 class="">Hierarchy</h3> 
        <p class="">The hierachy of my site is as follows: Home, About Me, Site Design, Plain Language, Contact Me.
            I chose this specfic navigation order because I wanted to showcase the most important topics about me and the work I 
            do in this webpage first, and then end with a way to contact me if you want to collaborate or have questions. 
            The titles of the navigation's tabs are simple and straightforward, so that user's know exactly what the page will 
            be about before they click on the page. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="">Sequential Model</h3>
        <p class="">When it comes to the structural design of my webpage, I chose a sequential model in order to showcase the important work first.
            You can see this specifically on the homepage. In the first section there is a button that takes you to the About Me page. This is 
        important because it will show first time users infromation about me. As you go down the page you will see cases of flexbox, two different types 
        of tables, and a reference sheet. These items are very important to know when it comes to accessibility because of the knowledge you need to know in order
        to effectively code the tables for screen readers. </p>
